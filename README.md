## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I was struggling with the layout of the development. Using AI and Google I came to the right conclusion
- I was struggling with GRID layout. Using AI and Google I came to the right solution, which makes my design more robust.
- I was also struggling with the JS. Since I do not have that much experience yet, it was a bit tricky to get the state of the buttons, but once I had found the solution it was relatively easy.
